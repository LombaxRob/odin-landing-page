# odin-landing-page

Working on the 2nd Odin Project task, need to make use of HTML, CSS and Flex.

## Project Idea

I will be build my webpage as a tribute to my first pet Shep who I sadly lost this year (2025). I had him for a year and got him from the same rescue my partner's family got their cats from. He was a lovely boy and while he already had the name Shep we decided he was named after Commander Shepard from the Mass Effect games.
